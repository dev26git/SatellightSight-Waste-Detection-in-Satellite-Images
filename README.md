# SatellightSight
## Waste Detection in Satellite Images using Machine Learning

A Machine Learning approach to detect waste dumps using satellite images.  
I use texture analysis techniques like GLCM and LBP.  
I also created a state-of-the-art Sliding Window Algorithm to analyse sub-images. It is adapted to the training data used for the model.  
A binary classifier model is used to classify each sub-image of a given satellite image into 2 categories- waste or non-waste.
